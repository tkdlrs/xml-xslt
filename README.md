# Repo for messing around with XML and XSLT

Using data obtained from the Pokemon API at < https://pokeapi.co/ >

Litterally what it sounds like. I'm taking data on the first 358 pokemon turned it into XML data and trying to do some rather simple things using XSLT transformations. Why? Well wynaut? (^_^)b -I know best pun ever. ~I win.

XSLT and XML are basically dead standards by now but some technology stacks are still founded on and dependent on these technologies and I personally want to learn more about it so I am going to.
